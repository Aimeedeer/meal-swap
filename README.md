# meal-swap

A project to swap meals between a fat man and a skinny girl
for the purposes of losing and gaining weight.

## How it works

Each one prepares their own meal, and then serves it to the other.


## Swap-log!

#### Meal 1

Yogurt, Oats, Coffee.

Aimee's thoughts: 
I'm hungry, and I want more yogurt and honey rather than banana chips or walnuts.
I think I'm drinking milk but not coffee.

Brian's thoughts:
I'm not hungry in the morning.


#### Meal 2

Coffee (French press).

Aimee's thoughts:
I am eyeing Brian's coffee, that classic black coffee.

Brian's thoughts:
Aimee's coffee with a little bit of soy milk is delicious.
Mine is drinkable.
We don't typically use a French press.


#### Meal 3

Tofu and broccoli,
fried in olive oil,
paired with CBD sparkling water that we received as a housewarming gift.

Aimee's thoughts:
I am not a big fan of fried food, but I do like fried tofu.
The tree(broccoli) tastes great with a bit of fried flour on it.
I want more vegetables and I feed those to Brian, but I couldn't eat more tofu as his appetite.

Brian's thoughts:
We struggled to figure out how to swap a shared plate.
In the end we picked the bites we wanted,
and traded them.
I did not receive a satisfying quantity of tofu.

The CBD water was as dumb as expected &mdash;
bad taste, no chill.
I do in general though appreciate Untitled Art,
the producer,
who commission lots of interesting untraditional beers in the midwest.


#### Meal 4

French wine of some kind.

We went on a walk to get groceries,
but an intoxicated man without a mask was blocking
the grocery store entrance and harassing people.

So we kept walking and found an excellent wine store.

Aimee's thoughts:
This might be the oldest wine I've ever had. It tastes not-waking-up yet at first,
and still very tenderÂ  in last glass. We've been confusing about
"I want more, should I pour another in my glass or his/her glass".

Brian's thoughts:
TBD
